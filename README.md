# Roundcube-Next-Fraud

Roundcube Next was part of a rewards-based crowdfunding campaign [on Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/roundcube-next--2#/), launched on 3 May 2015.
The European Commission defines the most important requirements of a [rewards-based crowdfunding campaign](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/crowdfunding-guide/types/rewards_en):

**- you just deliver the service or the goods promised ;
- you are obliged to deliver on your promises on schedule.**

No service nor good have been delivered.
Therefore, backers of the "Roundcube Next" campaign should be refunded by Kolab Systems AG OR Apheleia IT AG.
Most of the business assets of Kolab Systems AG have been transferred to Apheleia IT AG.

The most important question is: where is located the debt technically? At Kolab Systems AG or Apheleia IT AG. There is no simple answer to that.
For most debts, the time limit is 6 years since you last wrote to them or made a payment.
You can still take a company to court to ask them to pay their debt after the time limit is up.

Apheleia IT AG is registered in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland.
Between Switzerland and the EEA, you have the [Lugano Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_Regime#Lugano_convention_(2007)) (2007).

Most of the questions are:

 - Who to sue?
 - How to sue?
 - Until when you can sue?
